This mod introduces two backpack models (thanks to Cinnabunn!) to the game. You can open them with a hotkey (_i_ by default) and store items in them. It's an expansion on Aedenthorn's [BackpackRedux](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1333) mod, and it relies heavily on their precursor work.

### Features
* Each backpack has its own separate inventory, and their inventories are preserved even when you toss your backpack to a friend.
* Storing items in the backpack reduces their weight by 50% by default (configurable).
* You can also configure how much they modify your carry capacity and movement speed.
* [Localization support](https://valheim-modding.github.io/Jotunn/tutorials/localization.html#example-json-file). Please let me know if you want to add a translation for your language!
* You cannot teleport with unteleportable items in the backpack.
* Nor can you put a backpack inside a backpack in order to get around this limitation!

### Server
* Should be installed on both server and on all clients. If the mod is on the server, it will disconnect clients without the mod.
* All configs (except hotkey) are server-enforceable.
