# JÃ¶tunnBackpacks

A work in project. Almost done.

### Credit goes to
 * [Cinnabunn/Evie](https://github.com/capnbubs) for their 'eviesbackpacks' assets inside [JotunnModExample](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/JotunnModExample/tree/master/JotunnModExample/AssetsEmbedded)
 * Randy Knapp for their [Extended Item Framework](https://github.com/RandyKnapp/ValheimMods/tree/main/ExtendedItemDataFramework), without which I wouldn't be able to do this project.
 * Aedenthorn for their [BackpackRedux](https://github.com/aedenthorn/ValheimMods/blob/master/BackpackRedux/) mod, which I learned a great deal from.
 * [sbtoonz](https://github.com/VMP-Valheim/Back_packs) for initial help with the IsTeleportable_Patch.
 * The Jotunn Team for creating [Jotunn: The Valheim Library](https://valheim-modding.github.io/Jotunn/index.html), which makes modding life a lot more convenient.

Most of this project is the result of the hard work of these people. All I've done is combine their efforts into this mod and smoothed out issues.
