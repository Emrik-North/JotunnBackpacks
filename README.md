# JÃ¶tunnBackpacks

This mod introduces two backpack models (thanks to Cinnabunn!) to the game. You can open them with a hotkey (_i_ by default) and store items in them.

### Features
* Each backpack has their own separate inventory, and their inventories are preserved even if you toss your backpack to a friend.
* Storing items in the backpack reduces their weight by 50% by default (configurable).
* You can also configure how much they modify your carry capacity and movement speed.
* You cannot teleport with unteleportable items in the backpack.
* You cannot put a backpack inside a backpack in order to get around this limitation.

### Server
* Should be installed on the server and on all clients. If the mod is on the server, it will disconnect clients without the mod.

 * Randy Knapp for their [Extended Item Framework](https://github.com/RandyKnapp/ValheimMods/tree/main/ExtendedItemDataFramework), without which I wouldn't be able to do this project.
 * Aedenthorn for their [BackpackRedux](https://github.com/aedenthorn/ValheimMods/blob/master/BackpackRedux/) mod, which I learned a great deal from.
 * [sbtoonz](https://github.com/VMP-Valheim/Back_packs) for initial help with the IsTeleportable_Patch.
 * The Jotunn Team for creating [Jotunn: The Valheim Library](https://valheim-modding.github.io/Jotunn/index.html), which makes modding life a lot more convenient.
 * MarcoPogo and Jules for helping me with some questions I had in the [Jotunn Discord](https://discord.gg/DdUt6g7gyA).

Most of this project is the result of the hard work of these awesome people!

### Todo
 * Try my darndest to break things before it's ready for official release.
 * Make compatible with Randy's Project Auga.

### Compatibility notes
 * _No mod conflicts that I know of yet._

Please let me know if you find any additional bugs, issues or incompatibilities.
