# JÃ¶tunnBackpacks

Credit for the backpack models goes to [Cinnabunn/Evie](https://github.com/capnbubs).
Thanks to RandyKnapp for the [Extended Item Data Framework](https://github.com/RandyKnapp/ValheimMods/tree/main/ExtendedItemDataFramework).
Thanks to the Jotunn team for the modding framework this mod is built from.
Thanks to Aedenthorn for their [Backpack Redux]() mod, whose code I use to make this mod work.

## TODO
* Add unique IDs to backpacks using [Extended Item Data Framework](https://github.com/RandyKnapp/ValheimMods/tree/main/ExtendedItemDataFramework) (RandyKnapp), to prevent you from being able to access the same inventory by crafting backpacks in different locations.
